## How the 5-Hour Delay System Works

### 1. Admin Generates Challenges
1. Admin enters species code (`tyrannosaurus-apex-2024`)
2. Admin generates/modifies challenges in preview
3. Admin approves changes

### 2. History Entry Created
- Action logged with timestamp, admin info, challenges
- Status: "pending"
- Scheduled execution time: Current time + 5 hours

### 3. Pending Update Scheduled
- Challenges stored in pending state
- Players see notification about upcoming update
- Countdown timer shows time remaining

### 4. Automatic Execution
- System checks every minute for due updates
- When time arrives, challenges automatically go live
- History entry status changed to "active"
- Players receive notification about live challenges
- Old challenges replaced with new ones

### 5. Notification to Players
- "Challenge Update Scheduled" notification appears
- Shows countdown timer until activation
- "Daily Challenges Updated!" notification when live

## Testing Instructions

4. Access granted to admin functions

### 2. Test the Delay System (Quick Demo)
1. After admin verification, click "üß™ Test Delay System"
2. This creates a 30-second test (instead of 5 hours)
3. Watch the pending notification appear
4. Wait 30 seconds for automatic activation
5. New challenges will replace current ones

### 3. View Admin History

2. Generate new set of challenges
3. Preview and approve changes
4. System schedules update for 5 hours later
5. Players see "Challenge Update Scheduled" notification
6. Challenges automatically go live after 5 hours

## Notification Types

## Storage System

All data persists in localStorage:
- `challengeHistory`: Complete admin action history
- `pendingChallengeUpdate`: Scheduled updates awaiting activation

- `dailyChallenges`: Current active challenges
- `challengesDate`: Date of current challenges

## Security Features

- **Species code verification**: Only admins with correct code can access
- **Session tracking**: Each admin session logged with details
- **Action logging**: Every modification recorded with timestamp
- **Admin identification**: User agent and session ID tracked
- **Immutable history**: Previous actions cannot be modified

## Advanced Features

- Reschedule capabilities

## Development Notes

- System checks for pending updates every 60 seconds
- Notifications refresh every 30 seconds
- History entries are immutable once created
