# 🔧 STEAM AUTHENTICATION DOMAIN ISSUE - SOLUTION REQUIRED

## 🚨 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

**Issue**: Steam authentication isn't working because the Steam API key was likely registered for a different domain.

**Evidence**: 
- Your website loads perfectly ✅
- Auth routes are configured ✅  
- But Steam OAuth isn't redirecting properly ❌

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE

The Steam API key `FA6CC87B466294D99D31962953039784` in your environment variables was probably registered for:
- A different domain
- localhost testing  
- Or needs domain verification for ashveil.live

## ✅ SOLUTION STEPS

### 1. Register NEW Steam API Key for ashveil.live

**Go to**: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

**Register with:**
- **Domain Name**: `ashveil.live`
- **Project Name**: `Ashveil Isle Server Website`

### 2. Update Environment Variables in Netlify

Once you get the new API key:
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → ashveil.live site
2. Site settings → Environment variables  
3. Update `STEAM_API_KEY` with the new key

### 3. Update Steam Web API Domain Settings

Make sure the Steam Web API is configured for:
- **Domain**: `ashveil.live`
- **Return URL**: `https://ashveil.live/auth/steam/return`

## 🔄 ALTERNATIVE QUICK TEST

If you want to test if this is the domain issue, you can temporarily:

1. **Check the current Steam API key domain** at https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
2. **Add ashveil.live** to the allowed domains if possible
3. **Or create a new key** specifically for ashveil.live

## 📋 EXPECTED RESULT AFTER FIX

**When working correctly:**
1. User clicks "Sign in with Steam" on ashveil.live
2. Redirects to Steam OAuth with "Sign into ashveil.live using your Steam account"  
3. User authorizes on Steam
4. Returns to ashveil.live logged in

## 💡 WHY DINODEN.GG WORKS

The Dino Den website works because:
- ✅ Their Steam API key is registered for `dinoden.gg`
- ✅ Their OAuth return URLs point to their domain
- ✅ Steam recognizes their domain as authorized

**Your site needs the same domain-specific Steam API configuration!**

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Register new Steam API key** for ashveil.live domain
2. **Update Netlify environment variables** with new key
3. **Test Steam authentication** - should work like dinoden.gg example
4. **Enjoy working Steam OAuth!** 🎮

**This is a common issue - just need the API key registered for the correct domain!**
