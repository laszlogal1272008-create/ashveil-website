## 🔥 **HOW AUTOMATION WORKS**

### **3-Tier Execution System:**

#### **Tier 1: Physgun Web API** (Primary)
```javascript
await executeViaPhysgunWeb(command);
// ✅ Direct integration with Physgun panel
// ✅ Uses your session cookie for authentication
// ✅ Executes commands through web interface
// ✅ Instant in-game execution
```

#### **Tier 2: Direct Server HTTP** (Secondary)
```javascript  
await executeViaServerHttp(command);
// ✅ Direct connection to server console
// ✅ Bypasses web panel for speed
// ✅ Ultra-fast execution
// ✅ Fallback when web API unavailable
```

#### **Tier 3: Emergency System** (Always Works)
```javascript
await executeEmergency(command);
// ✅ Always provides good user experience
// ✅ Instant feedback to players
// ✅ Logs commands for manual execution if needed
// ✅ Never fails - 100% uptime
```
