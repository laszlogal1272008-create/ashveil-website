# Physgun Console Configuration

Please update the physgun-console-manager.js file with your actual Physgun panel details:

## Required Information:

1. **Physgun Panel URL**: The web address of your Physgun control panel
   - Example: https://control.physgun.com or https://panel.yourhost.com
   - Replace 'https://your-physgun-panel-url.com' in physgun-console-manager.js

2. **Username**: Your Physgun panel login username
   - Replace 'your-username' in physgun-console-manager.js

3. **Password**: Your Physgun panel login password  
   - Replace 'your-password' in physgun-console-manager.js

## Security Notes:
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive data
- The password will be used to automatically log into your Physgun console
- Make sure your Physgun panel has console access enabled

## What This Does:
Instead of trying to use RCON (which isn't responding), this system will:
1. Log into your Physgun web panel automatically
2. Use the console interface directly (like your friend did)
3. Execute commands like 'KillCharacter PlayerName' 
4. Return the results to your website

This is exactly how your friend got it working - through the Physgun console interface!
