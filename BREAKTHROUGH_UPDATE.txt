ðŸŽ¯ BREAKTHROUGH UPDATE - CORRECT COMMAND FOUND!
=====================================================

The correct RCON command format is: /slay <player name>

LOCAL TESTING RESULTS:
âœ… '/slay Misplacedcursor' â†’ "Playables list was updated" (SUCCESS!)
âœ… 'slay Misplacedcursor'  â†’ No special response (old format)

WHAT THIS MEANS:
- Your enhanced bridge now has the correct /slay command first in the list
- The website integration is working perfectly
- We just need to deploy the updated bridge to your VPS

IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:
1. Deploy the updated rcon-bridge-enhanced-24x7.js to your VPS
2. The enhanced bridge will now try /slay first (correct format)
3. Your website slay button should work immediately!

- Or access your VPS console and paste the updated bridge file
- Start it with: pm2 start rcon-bridge-enhanced.js --name rcon-enhanced

EXPECTED RESULT:
