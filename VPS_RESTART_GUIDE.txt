🎯 VPS BRIDGE RESTART GUIDE
=============================

The /slay command IS WORKING! The server responded with:
"Playables list was updated to:" 

This means you were removed from active players!

TO UPDATE YOUR VPS BRIDGE:

1. SSH into your VPS (104.131.111.229)
2. Stop the current bridge:
   pm2 stop rcon-bridge

3. Update the bridge with correct /slay command:
   nano rcon-bridge-enhanced.js
   
4. Update the slay command list to put /slay first:
   const slayCommands = [
       '/slay Misplacedcursor',           // WORKING! 
       '/kill Misplacedcursor',           
       'pslay Misplacedcursor',           
       // ... rest
   ];

5. Restart the bridge:
   pm2 start rcon-bridge-enhanced.js --name rcon-bridge
   pm2 save

6. Test your website again!

ALTERNATIVE QUICK FIX:
The enhanced bridge you created already has /slay first in the list!
Just make sure it's running on your VPS.

THE SLAY COMMAND IS WORKING! 🎉
