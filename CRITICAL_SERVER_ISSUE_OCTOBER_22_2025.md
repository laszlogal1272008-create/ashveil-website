# üö® CRITICAL SERVER CONNECTION ISSUE - OCTOBER 22, 2025

## **Problem Identified: Players Connecting to Wrong Port**

### **Error Evidence:**
```
UNetConnection::Tick: Connection TIMED OUT. Closing connection.. 
Elapsed: 20.00, Real: 20.00, Good: 20.00, DriverTime: 20.03, Threshold: 20.00, 
[UNetConnection] RemoteAddr: 45.45.238.134:16007, Name: RedpointEOS|pNetConnection_2147478509, 
Driver: Name:PendingNetDriver Def:GameNetDriver RedpointEOSNetDriver_2147478513, 
IsServer: NO, PC: NULL, Owner: NULL, Uniqueld: INVALID
```

### **Critical Analysis:**
- **RemoteAddr: 45.45.238.134:16007** - Players connecting to RCON port
- **Connection TIMED OUT** - Game clients can't establish proper connection
- **IsServer: NO** - Client-side connection attempt failing

---

## **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Port Status Confirmed:**
```powershell
# Game Port (what players need):
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 45.45.238.134 -Port 7777   # ‚ùå FAILED - BLOCKED

# RCON Port (admin only):
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 45.45.238.134 -Port 16007  # ‚úÖ SUCCESS - OPEN

# Query Port (website data):
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 45.45.238.134 -Port 16006  # ‚ùå FAILED - BLOCKED
```

### **The Problem:**
1. **Game Port 7777**: Still completely blocked by hosting provider
2. **Players are somehow connecting to port 16007** (RCON port)
3. **RCON port is not designed for game connections** ‚Üí Immediate timeout
4. **Server appears "online" but is completely unusable**

---

## **Immediate Action Required**

### **üö® URGENT: Contact Hosting Provider**
- **Subject**: "CRITICAL: Game Port 7777 Still Blocked - Server Unusable"
- **Evidence**: Include the connection error logs above
- **Emphasis**: Port 16007 being open doesn't help - need port 7777 for game connections
- **Priority**: URGENT - Server completely non-functional

### **Support Ticket Information:**
```
Server IP: 45.45.238.134
Issue: Game port 7777 blocked - players cannot join server
Evidence: Players timing out with connections to port 16007 (RCON)
Required: Open port 7777 for TCP game connections
Current Status: Port 16007 open but wrong port type
Impact: Server completely unusable, 0 players can join
```

---

## **Technical Details for Support**

### **Isle Server Port Requirements:**
- **Port 7777 (TCP)**: Main game port - CRITICAL - players connect here
- **Port 16006 (UDP)**: Query port - for server browser/website data  
- **Port 16007 (TCP)**: RCON port - admin commands only

### **Current Hosting Provider Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Port 16007**: Open (RCON) - but wrong port for players
- ‚ùå **Port 7777**: Blocked (GAME) - THIS IS THE CRITICAL ISSUE
- ‚ùå **Port 16006**: Blocked (QUERY) - prevents server data

### **Why This is Critical:**
Players **MUST** connect to port 7777 for gameplay. Port 16007 is only for admin commands and will always timeout for game connections. The server is completely unusable until port 7777 is opened.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Submit urgent support ticket with this evidence
2. **Emphasis**: Port 7777 is critical - server is unusable without it  
3. **Monitor**: Check port 7777 accessibility regularly
4. **Test**: Once opened, verify with `Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 45.45.238.134 -Port 7777`

## **For Website Development**

While waiting for port resolution, continue with:
- ‚úÖ **Database Integration**: Get Supabase anon key (5 minutes)
- ‚úÖ **OAuth Setup**: Get Steam/Discord API keys (15 minutes)
- ‚úÖ **Website Features**: All frontend features work independently

The website is fully functional - this is purely a server connection issue that requires hosting provider intervention.
