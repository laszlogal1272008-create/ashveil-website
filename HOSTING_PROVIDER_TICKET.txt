Subject: URGENT: Game Server Port 7777 Still Blocked - Server Completely Unusable

Priority: CRITICAL - Server Down

Dear Support Team,

I am writing to report a CRITICAL issue with my game server that requires immediate attention. My Isle of Titans game server is completely unusable because the main game port is still blocked by your firewall.

SERVER DETAILS:
- Server IP: 45.45.238.134
- Game: The Isle of Titans (Dedicated Server)
- Issue: Game port 7777 blocked, preventing all player connections

CURRENT PROBLEM:
My game server is completely inaccessible to players. When players attempt to connect, they are getting connection timeout errors because the main game port (7777) is blocked by your firewall.

ERROR EVIDENCE:
Players are receiving this error when trying to connect:
```
UNetConnection::Tick: Connection TIMED OUT. Closing connection.. 
Elapsed: 20.00, Real: 20.00, Good: 20.00, DriverTime: 20.03, Threshold: 20.00, 
[UNetConnection] RemoteAddr: 45.45.238.134:16007, Name: RedpointEOS|pNetConnection_2147478509, 
Driver: Name:PendingNetDriver Def:GameNetDriver RedpointEOSNetDriver_2147478513, 
IsServer: NO, PC: NULL, Owner: NULL, Uniqueld: INVALID
```

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
The error shows players are connecting to port 16007 (RCON port) instead of port 7777 (game port), which indicates port 7777 is completely blocked. This causes immediate timeouts because RCON ports are not designed for game connections.

PORT STATUS VERIFICATION:
I have tested the ports and confirmed:
- Port 7777 (Game Port): BLOCKED - Connection failed
- Port 16007 (RCON Port): OPEN - Connection successful  
- Port 16006 (Query Port): BLOCKED - Connection failed

REQUIRED ACTION:
Please open the following ports IMMEDIATELY:

1. **PORT 7777 (TCP) - CRITICAL PRIORITY**
   - This is the main game port that players connect to
   - Server is completely unusable without this port
   - No players can join until this is opened

2. Port 16006 (UDP) - Query/Server Browser
   - Allows server to appear in server browser
   - Enables website integration for live statistics

3. Port 16007 (TCP) - RCON (Open but Service Issue)
   - Administrative commands port is accessible
   - However, RCON service is not responding (connection timeouts)
   - May need server configuration check/restart

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Server has been completely unusable for players
- Cannot run my gaming community/business
- Revenue loss due to server downtime
- Player retention issues

PREVIOUS TICKETS:
I have submitted previous tickets about this issue, but the main game port (7777) has not been opened yet. Port 16007 being open doesn't solve the problem as it's only for admin commands.

TESTING COMMANDS:
Once the ports are opened, I will test with:
```
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 45.45.238.134 -Port 7777
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 45.45.238.134 -Port 16006
```

ADDITIONAL ISSUE - RCON SERVICE:
While port 16007 is now accessible, the RCON service itself is not responding. When I attempt to connect to RCON, the connection times out after 20 seconds with no authentication response. This suggests:
- RCON may not be enabled in the server configuration
- Server may need to be restarted to enable RCON properly
- RCON password/settings may need verification

If you have access to server configuration, please check that RCON is enabled with:
- RCONEnabled=True
- RCONPort=16007  
- RCONPassword=CookieMonster420

URGENCY:
This is a CRITICAL issue that requires immediate resolution. My game server is completely non-functional and unusable by players until port 7777 is opened. The RCON issue prevents administrative management. Every hour of delay results in further business impact and player loss.

Please prioritize opening port 7777 immediately and check the RCON configuration if possible. I am available for any additional information needed to resolve this quickly.

Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.

TECHNICAL REFERENCE FOR SUPPORT TEAM:
Game: The Isle of Titans (Unreal Engine)
Required Ports:
- 7777/TCP (Game) - CRITICAL - Players connect here - BLOCKED
- 16006/UDP (Query) - Server browser data - BLOCKED  
- 16007/TCP (RCON) - Admin commands - PORT OPEN, SERVICE NOT RESPONDING

Evidence: 
1. Connection logs show players timing out on port 16007 because they cannot access port 7777
2. RCON connection test: "Connection timeout after 20 seconds" - service not running

Server Configuration Check Needed:
- Verify RCON is enabled in server configuration
- Confirm RCON settings: Port 16007, Password: CookieMonster420
- May require server restart to activate RCON service
