# RCON Connection Bridge Solution

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ
**Austin from Physgun confirmed:**
- RCON port 16007 is **OPEN and working**
- They successfully connected with external tools
- **Issue: Render.com webhost blocks outbound connections** to custom ports

## Solution: Local RCON Bridge

Since Render.com blocks direct RCON connections, we need a local bridge service that:
1. Runs on your local machine/server
2. Connects to Isle RCON (45.45.238.134:16007)  
3. Exposes HTTP API for the website to use
4. Bypasses hosting restrictions

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Local RCON Bridge Service
- **Location**: Your local machine or VPS
- **Function**: Bridge between HTTP requests and RCON TCP
- **Port**: HTTP on 3002 (configurable)
- **Connection**: Direct TCP to 45.45.238.134:16007

### 2. Website API Calls
- **Current**: Direct RCON from Render.com (‚ùå blocked)
- **New**: HTTP to your bridge service (‚úÖ allowed)
- **Fallback**: Mock data when bridge unavailable

### 3. Security & Access
- **API Keys**: Authenticate bridge requests
- **CORS**: Allow website access
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse
- **Logging**: Track all commands

## Benefits
‚úÖ **Bypasses hosting restrictions**
‚úÖ **Keeps existing architecture** 
‚úÖ **Adds security layer**
‚úÖ **Enables local testing**
‚úÖ **Provides fallback options**

## Next Steps
1. Create local RCON bridge service
2. Update website to use bridge API
3. Test end-to-end connection
4. Deploy and go live!

The RCON server works - we just need to route around the hosting limitation! üöÄ
