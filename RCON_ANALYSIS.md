## RCON Issue Analysis

**Current Status:**
- ✅ TCP connection to port 16007 successful
- ✅ Server is fully loaded and online
- ✅ Game.ini has correct RCON configuration
- ❌ Server not responding to RCON authentication packets

**Austin's Success Evidence:**
- Austin's TheIsleEvrimaRcon tool connected successfully on Oct 23rd
- Showed "Connected to 45.45.238.134:16007" and "Ready to execute commands"

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Missing Engine.ini Configuration:**
   - Many Unreal servers need RCON enabled in both Game.ini AND Engine.ini
   - Need to check /home/container/TheIsle/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/Engine.ini

2. **RCON Service Not Starting:**
   - Game.ini config might be correct but RCON service not initializing
   - No RCON initialization logs visible in server startup

3. **Port Configuration Mismatch:**
   - Server might be listening on port 16007 for something else
   - RCON might be on a different port

4. **Recent Server Changes:**
   - Something changed between Austin's success (Oct 23) and now (Oct 24)
   - Possible server update or configuration reset

**Next Steps:**
1. Check for Engine.ini file and add RCON settings if missing
2. Search server files for any additional RCON configuration files
3. Restart server and watch for any RCON-related log messages
4. Consider if Austin used a different approach/protocol
