### Hi Austin,

I need help with the Isle server configuration - I think I caused some port issues.

**Current Situation:**
- I changed the ports earlier when RCON wasn't working initially
- Now RCON (16007) and queue port (16008) are working ✅
- But the game port is not responding ❌
- The Isle server "Ashveil - 3X growth - low rules - website" doesn't show up in the game browser

**What's Working:**
- ✅ RCON port 16007 - responding
- ✅ Queue port 16008 - responding  
- ✅ Website https://ashveil.live - fully operational
- ✅ Server IP 45.45.238.134 - pingable

**What's Not Working:**
- ❌ Game port (tried 7777 and 16006) - connection refused
- ❌ Server not visible in Isle server browser

**Requested Actions:**
1. Restart the Isle Evrima server process
2. Verify the game port is binding correctly (should be 7777 standard or 16006 custom)
3. Check firewall rules for the game port
4. Confirm the server shows as "Ashveil - 3X growth - low rules - website" in browser

**Technical Details:**
- Server: 45.45.238.134
- Expected Game Port: 7777 (standard) or 16006 (if custom)
- RCON Port: 16007 ✅ (working)
- Queue Port: 16008 ✅ (working)

Thanks for your help with this! The website integration is working perfectly now thanks to your previous assistance.

Best regards,
[Your name]
